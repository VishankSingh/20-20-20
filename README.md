# 20-20-20

This is a very simple website which I created using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.<br>
It has been created to help the users follow 20-20-20 rule which helps to protect the eyes from prolonged usage of digital screens.<br>

**Allow the notifiactions and keep the site open.** A notification will be sent every 20 minutes and prompt you to look away.<br>

I have deployed the site on netlify.<br>
